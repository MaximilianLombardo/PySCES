- Project Structure: Organization of the codebase
- Next Steps: Short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals

### census-data-loaders-docs

Documentation for the CELLxGENE Census data loaders, including usage examples, API reference, and best practices. This document provides detailed information about integrating with the Census API and working with Census data.

### engineer_prompt.md

Engineering guidelines and best practices for contributing to the PySCES project. This document provides information about coding standards, architecture decisions, and development workflows.

### pysces_implementation_plan.md

The original implementation plan for the PySCES project, including the system architecture, project setup, and implementation phases. This document serves as a reference for the initial design and planning of the project.

### pysces_implementation_plan_update.md

Updates to the implementation plan based on progress and new insights. This document provides information about changes to the original plan and adjustments to the project roadmap.

### validation_tests.md

A comprehensive plan for validating the PySCES pipeline, including input data validation, algorithm validation, and edge case handling. This document outlines the tests that should be implemented to ensure the correctness and robustness of the pipeline.

### test_status.md

A document outlining the current status of tests in the PySCES project and the plan for improving test coverage. This document provides information about the current state of unit tests, manual validation, and the plan for implementing comprehensive validation tests.

### implementation_gameplan.md

A detailed implementation plan for the next phase of the PySCES project, focusing on three key areas: input data structure validation, comprehensive pipeline testing, and MLX/GPU acceleration for VIPER. This document outlines the objectives, implementation plans, and expected outcomes for each focus area.
