# Pipeline Validation Fixes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the pipeline validation issues in the PySCES project.

## Issue Summary

The pipeline validation test script was encountering an error after ARACNe ran successfully but before the network could be processed further. The specific error was:

```
✅ ARACNe completed successfully
❌ ARACNe failed: 'edges'
```

This indicated that there was an issue with accessing the 'edges' key in the network dictionary returned by ARACNe.

## Changes Made

### 1. Disabled C++ Extensions

The C++ extensions for ARACNe were causing issues and were not reliable. We decided to disable them and use the Python implementation exclusively:

- Modified `pysces/src/pysces/aracne/core.py` to always use the Python implementation
- Updated the `_check_cpp_extensions` method to always set `self._has_cpp_ext = False`
- Archived the C++ implementation by updating the README.md and __init__.py files in the `_cpp` directory

### 2. Added 'edges' Key to Network Dictionary

The ARACNe implementation was not including an 'edges' key in the network dictionary, which was causing the KeyError. We added this key:

- Modified the `_process_results` method in `pysces/src/pysces/aracne/core.py` to create an 'edges' list
- Each edge is a dictionary with 'source' (TF), 'target' (gene), and 'weight' (interaction strength)
- This makes the network dictionary compatible with downstream functions that expect an 'edges' key

### 3. Created Direct Import Version of Pipeline Validation Test

To avoid Python path issues, we created a version of the pipeline validation test script that uses direct imports from the src directory:

- Created `examples/pipeline_validation_test_direct.py` with direct imports
- Added better error handling and debugging output
- Updated the original script to reference the new direct import version

### 4. Updated Documentation

We updated the documentation to reflect the current state of the project:

- Updated `debugging_pipeline_validation.md` to mark the issue as resolved
- Updated `README.md` to reflect the current state of the project
- Updated the C++ extensions documentation to indicate they are archived
- Added this document to summarize the changes

## Results

The pipeline validation test now runs successfully, and the validation functions are working correctly to catch invalid data. The complete pipeline flow is now:

1. AnnData → Validation
2. ARACNe → Gene Regulatory Network
3. Network → Regulons
4. VIPER → Protein Activity

Each step validates its inputs before processing, ensuring data integrity throughout the pipeline.

## Future Work

- Explore MLX and GPU acceleration as alternatives to C++ extensions
- Further optimize the Python implementation for large datasets
- Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases
- Improve documentation and examples
