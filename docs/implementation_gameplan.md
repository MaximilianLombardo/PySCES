# PySCES Implementation Gameplan

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for the next phase of the PySCES project, focusing on three key areas:

1. Input data structure validation
2. Comprehensive pipeline testing
3. MLX/GPU acceleration for VIPER

## 1. Input Data Structure Validation

### Objective
Implement formal validation of input data structures to ensure that the pipeline receives appropriate data and provides meaningful error messages when it doesn't.

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: AnnData Validation (1-2 days)
- **Create validation module**: `pysces/src/pysces/utils/validation.py`
- **Implement basic AnnData validators**:
  - `validate_anndata_structure(adata)`: Check that the AnnData object has the expected structure
  - `validate_gene_names(adata)`: Check that gene names are present and unique
  - `validate_cell_names(adata)`: Check that cell names are present and unique

#### Phase 2: Expression Data Validation (2-3 days)
- **Implement expression data validators**:
  - `validate_raw_counts(adata)`: Check if data appears to be raw counts (integers, non-negative)
  - `validate_normalized_data(adata)`: Check if data appears to be normalized (floats, distribution)
  - `validate_sparse_matrix(adata)`: Handle sparse matrices appropriately
  - `recommend_preprocessing(adata)`: Suggest preprocessing steps based on data characteristics

#### Phase 3: Integration with Pipeline (1-2 days)
- **Integrate validators with ARACNe**:
  - Add validation calls to ARACNe.run() method
  - Provide clear error messages and suggestions
- **Integrate validators with VIPER**:
  - Add validation calls to viper() function
  - Ensure compatibility with different data types

#### Phase 4: Documentation and Examples (1 day)
- **Document validation functions**:
  - Add detailed docstrings with examples
  - Create validation examples in the examples directory
- **Add validation to tutorials**:
  - Show how to check data before running the pipeline
  - Demonstrate handling of validation errors

### Expected Outcomes
- Robust validation of input data structures
- Clear error messages with suggestions for fixing issues
- Improved user experience with the pipeline
- Reduced likelihood of meaningless results due to inappropriate data

## 2. Comprehensive Pipeline Testing

### Objective
Develop a comprehensive test suite for the full ARACNe → VIPER pipeline to ensure correctness, robustness, and reproducibility.

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure (2-3 days)
- **Create test data generators**:
  - `generate_synthetic_expression_data()`: Create synthetic expression data with known patterns
  - `generate_synthetic_network()`: Create synthetic networks with known properties
  - `generate_synthetic_regulons()`: Create synthetic regulons with known targets
- **Set up test fixtures**:
  - Create fixtures for common test scenarios
  - Implement parameterized tests for different configurations

#### Phase 2: Unit Tests (3-4 days)
- **Fix existing unit tests**:
  - Update import paths and expected values
  - Ensure all tests pass with current implementation
- **Add new unit tests**:
  - Test edge cases for ARACNe (constant genes, highly correlated genes)
  - Test edge cases for VIPER (empty regulons, single-target regulons)
  - Test parameter sensitivity for both algorithms

#### Phase 3: Integration Tests (2-3 days)
- **Implement end-to-end pipeline tests**:
  - Test ARACNe → VIPER pipeline with synthetic data
  - Test with different parameter combinations
  - Verify results against expected patterns
- **Test with real data**:
  - Create small test datasets from real data
  - Verify reproducibility with fixed random seeds
  - Compare results with reference implementations

#### Phase 4: Performance and Stress Tests (2-3 days)
- **Implement performance benchmarks**:
  - Measure execution time for different dataset sizes
  - Compare CPU vs. GPU performance
  - Identify performance bottlenecks
- **Implement stress tests**:
  - Test with very large datasets
  - Test with very small datasets
  - Test with missing values and other edge cases

### Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive test suite for the full pipeline
- Improved confidence in the correctness of the implementation
- Identification and fixing of edge case bugs
- Performance benchmarks for different configurations

## 3. MLX/GPU Acceleration for VIPER

### Objective

  - Add GPU option to viper() function
  - Implement automatic fallback to CPU when GPU is not available
  - Optimize memory usage for large datasets
- **Optimize performance**:
  - Identify and eliminate bottlenecks
  - Minimize data transfers between CPU and GPU
  - Implement batch processing for large datasets

#### Phase 4: Testing and Benchmarking (2-3 days)
- **Test correctness**:
  - Compare GPU results with CPU results
  - Ensure numerical stability across different datasets
  - Verify edge case handling
