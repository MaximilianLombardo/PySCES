# PySCES Validation Tests

This document outlines the validation tests that should be implemented to ensure the correctness and robustness of the PySCES pipeline.

## Input Data Validation

### Raw Counts vs. Normalized Data

- **Test**: Verify that the algorithm correctly identifies and handles raw counts vs. normalized data
- **Implementation**: Create test cases with both raw counts (integers) and normalized data (floats)
- **Expected Behavior**: The algorithm should detect the data type and apply appropriate preprocessing

### Sparse Matrix Handling

- **Test**: Verify that the algorithm correctly handles sparse matrices
- **Implementation**: Create test cases with sparse matrices of different formats (CSR, CSC, COO)
- **Expected Behavior**: The algorithm should handle sparse matrices efficiently without errors

### AnnData Structure Validation

- **Test**: Verify that the algorithm works with different AnnData structures
- **Implementation**: Create test cases with different AnnData configurations (with/without raw attribute, different layers)
- **Expected Behavior**: The algorithm should correctly access and process data from different AnnData structures

## ARACNe Validation

### Network Inference with Known Ground Truth

- **Test**: Verify that ARACNe correctly infers known regulatory relationships
- **Implementation**: Create synthetic datasets with known regulatory relationships
- **Expected Behavior**: ARACNe should recover a significant portion of the known relationships

### Bootstrapping Parameter Sensitivity

- **Test**: Verify the stability of the network with different bootstrapping parameters
- **Implementation**: Run ARACNe with different numbers of bootstraps and consensus thresholds
- **Expected Behavior**: The network should stabilize as the number of bootstraps increases

### Edge Case Handling

- **Test**: Verify that ARACNe correctly handles edge cases
- **Implementation**: Create test cases with low expression genes, highly correlated genes, and constant genes
- **Expected Behavior**: ARACNe should handle these edge cases without errors or numerical instability

## VIPER Validation

### Known Regulon Testing

- **Test**: Verify that VIPER correctly calculates activity scores with known regulons
- **Implementation**: Create test cases with known regulons from literature
- **Expected Behavior**: VIPER should produce activity scores that match expected patterns

### Comparison with Reference Implementation

- **Test**: Compare results with the original R implementation
- **Implementation**: Run both implementations on the same dataset and compare results
- **Expected Behavior**: Results should be highly correlated between implementations

### Enrichment Method Comparison

- **Test**: Compare different enrichment methods (GSEA vs. aREA)
- **Implementation**: Run VIPER with different enrichment methods on the same dataset
- **Expected Behavior**: Results should be consistent across methods, with expected differences

## End-to-End Pipeline Tests

### Full Pipeline on Different Datasets

- **Test**: Verify that the full pipeline works on different datasets
- **Implementation**: Run the pipeline on datasets from different organisms and tissue types
- **Expected Behavior**: The pipeline should complete without errors and produce biologically meaningful results

### Reproducibility Testing

- **Test**: Verify that the pipeline produces reproducible results
- **Implementation**: Run the pipeline multiple times with fixed random seeds
- **Expected Behavior**: Results should be identical across runs with the same seed

### Parameter Sensitivity

- **Test**: Verify the sensitivity of the pipeline to different parameter settings
- **Implementation**: Run the pipeline with different parameter combinations
- **Expected Behavior**: Results should change in expected ways with parameter changes

## Edge Case Handling

### Small Dataset Testing

- **Test**: Verify that the pipeline works with very small datasets
- **Implementation**: Run the pipeline on datasets with few cells and/or genes
- **Expected Behavior**: The pipeline should handle small datasets gracefully

### Large Dataset Testing

- **Test**: Verify that the pipeline works with very large datasets
- **Implementation**: Run the pipeline on datasets with many cells and/or genes
- **Expected Behavior**: The pipeline should handle large datasets efficiently

### Missing Value Handling

- **Test**: Verify that the pipeline correctly handles missing values
- **Implementation**: Create test cases with missing values or zeros
- **Expected Behavior**: The pipeline should handle missing values appropriately
