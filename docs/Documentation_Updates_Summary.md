- **Next Steps**: Outlined the next steps for integrating the fixed extensions

## Recent Progress (April 18, 2025 Update)

Since the initial documentation updates, significant progress has been made:

1. **Fixed C++ Extensions**: The C++ extensions have been successfully fixed and compiled:
   - `fix_mi.py` contains implementations for MI calculation fixes
   - `debug_mi.py` includes comprehensive tests for the fixed functionality
   - `setup_fixed.py` includes platform-specific build improvements
   - The fixed extensions have been compiled (`aracne_ext_fixed.cpython-310-darwin.so`)

2. **Documentation Updates**: The documentation has been updated to reflect this progress:
   - `cpp_extension_integration_prompt.md` now focuses on integrating the fixed extensions
   - `ARACNe_Implementation_Summary.md` now includes detailed information about the implementation progress

## Path Forward

### Immediate Next Steps (0-2 weeks)

1. **Integrate Fixed C++ Extensions**
   - Use the updated cpp_extension_integration_prompt.md document as a guide
   - Focus on integrating the fixed extensions into the main package
   - Update the package configuration to use the fixed extensions
   - Update the core.py file to use the fixed extensions
   - Consolidate the debug tests into the formal test suite

2. **Expand Test Suite**
   - Add unit tests for all components of the ARACNe implementation
   - Create integration tests for end-to-end workflows
   - Add performance benchmarks

### Short-term Goals (2-4 weeks)

1. **Fix Census Integration**
   - Update batch processing approach to use TileDB-SOMA-ML API
   - Document any limitations or workarounds

2. **Improve Documentation**
   - Complete API documentation with examples
   - Create user guide with installation and usage instructions
   - Document algorithm parameters and their effects

3. **Set Up Package Distribution**
   - Set up PyPI distribution for easy installation
   - Create conda package for the conda ecosystem

### Medium-term Goals (1-3 months)

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile and optimize critical code paths
   - Further optimize memory usage for large datasets
   - Add support for out-of-core processing

2. **Advanced Analysis Features**
   - Implement additional clustering methods
   - Add differential network analysis
   - Implement network comparison tools

3. **GPU Acceleration**
   - Implement GPU-accelerated mutual information calculation
   - Add GPU support for network pruning

## Conclusion

The PySCES project has made significant progress, particularly in the ARACNe implementation. The C++ extensions have been fixed to correctly calculate mutual information, handle edge cases, and ensure numerical stability. The next steps focus on integrating these fixed extensions into the main package, expanding the test suite, improving documentation, and setting up package distribution.

The updated documentation provides a clear roadmap for the project and detailed information about the current status, challenges, and solutions. This will help new contributors understand the project and guide future development efforts.
