Key components:
- Data preprocessing
- Clustering and dimensionality reduction
- Visualization tools
- Integration with other single-cell analysis tools

### TileDB-SOMA

A storage format for single-cell data that provides efficient access to large datasets. This implementation provides insights into handling large-scale single-cell data.

Key components:
- Data storage and retrieval
- Query optimization
- Integration with analysis tools

### cellxgene-census

Documentation and examples for accessing the CELLxGENE Census data. This resource provides insights into integrating with the Census API and working with Census data.

Key components:
- Census API documentation

## Usage

These reference implementations are provided for educational and reference purposes only. They are not intended to be used directly in the PySCES project, but rather to inform the design and implementation of PySCES components.

When implementing a new feature or algorithm in PySCES, it's recommended to:

1. Review the corresponding implementation in the reference code
2. Understand the algorithm and approach used
3. Adapt the implementation to the PySCES architecture and coding standards
4. Optimize for performance and memory usage
5. Add appropriate tests and documentation
