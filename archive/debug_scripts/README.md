# Archived Debug Scripts

This directory contains archived debug and test scripts that were used during the development of the PySCES project, particularly for debugging issues with the C++ extensions for ARACNe.

## Scripts

- **debug_mi.py**: Debug script for mutual information calculation issues in the C++ extensions.
- **fix_mi.py**: Script for fixing mutual information calculation issues in the C++ extensions.
- **setup_fixed.py**: Setup script for compiling the fixed ARACNe C++ extensions.
- **test_fixed.py**: Test script for the fixed ARACNe C++ extensions.
- **test_import.py**: Script for testing import paths for the ARACNe class.

## Note

These scripts are no longer actively used as the project now uses the Python implementation of ARACNe exclusively, which is more reliable and easier to debug. The C++ extensions have been disabled and archived.

These scripts are kept for reference purposes only and may not work with the current version of the codebase.
