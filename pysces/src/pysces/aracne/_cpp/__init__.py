"""
C++ extensions for ARACNe algorithm (ARCHIVED).

NOTE: These C++ extensions are currently disabled in favor of the Python implementation,
which is more reliable and easier to debug. This directory is kept for reference purposes only.

# The aracne_ext_fixed module has been archived
# It was an earlier version of the ARACNe C++ extension
# See pysces/archive/aracne_cpp/ for the archived files

# C++ extensions are disabled
# The Python implementation is used exclusively

# Uncomment to try using the C++ extensions (not recommended)
# try:
#     from . import aracne_ext
# except ImportError:
#     # If the C++ extension is not available, the Python fallback will be used
#     pass
